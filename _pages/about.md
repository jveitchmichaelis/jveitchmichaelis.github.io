I am a postdoc in the DS3Lab at ETH Zurich and Restor Eco. My research is funded by a Google.org grant project to explore how best to apply ML to datasets that Restor has collected (imagery, audio data, LIDAR, etc.) Previously I worked for the University of Wisconsin, Madison as a winterover for the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole, where I lived for just over a year in 2020-2021.

For a while, I've worked at the intersection of academia and industry. Some of the more interesting projects include: putting ML models in space to detect flooding, building intelligent drone payloads for endangered species conservation, maintaining the world's largest neutrino telescope, designing 3D imaging systems for extreme environments and trying to automate spectral calibration for astronomers everywhere.

I obtained my PhD from the Mullard Space Science Laboratory (University College London) in 2016, which won the Remote Sensing and Photogrammatery Society's annual award for best PhD thesis, as well as a scholarship from the Worshipful Company of Scientific Instrument Makers for excellence in instrumentation research.
